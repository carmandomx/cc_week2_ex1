/* *Instructions*
    You need to merge to sorted arrays containing only numbers

    For example you will receive the following arrays:
    arr1=[1,2,4]
    arr2=[1,3,4]

    and the expected output would be [1,1,2,3,4,4].

    Note: you cannot use the sort() array method and you cannot remove duplicates

/** DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME **/
const merged = (arrA, arrB) => {
  /* Only make changes below this comment */
  //Update repo to GH
  /* Only make changes below this comment */
};

/** DO NOT CHANGE THE LINE BELOW **/
module.exports.merged = merged;
